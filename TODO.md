# TODO - Loxone Smart Home

## Current Priority ðŸŽ¯

### Async Operation & Resource Management
- [ ] Improve async operation and shared resource handling
  - [ ] Ensure thread-safe access to shared MQTT client
  - [ ] Implement connection pooling for InfluxDB client
  - [ ] Add proper async locks for critical sections
  - [ ] Handle concurrent writes from multiple modules (UDP, Weather, Growatt)
  - [ ] Implement retry logic with exponential backoff
  - [ ] Add connection health monitoring
  
- [ ] Database write optimization
  - [ ] Implement write buffer with batch processing
  - [ ] Configure optimal batch sizes for performance
  - [ ] Add write queue with priority handling
  - [ ] Monitor and log write performance metrics
  - [ ] Handle backpressure when database is slow

### Logging Improvements
- [ ] Show timestamps in local timezone (Europe/Prague) instead of UTC
  - [ ] Update all logger formatters to use local timezone
  - [ ] Make timezone configurable via settings
  - [ ] Ensure consistency across all modules
  
- [ ] Define service names for better log identification
  - [ ] Add service prefix to all log messages (e.g., [UDP], [MQTT], [WEATHER], [GROWATT])
  - [ ] Use consistent service naming convention
  - [ ] Make it easy to filter logs by service

### Loxone Control Integration
- [ ] Implement ability to control charging/discharging/export from Loxone
  - [ ] Design MQTT topic structure for Loxone commands
  - [ ] Add MQTT subscribers for incoming control commands
  - [ ] Implement override logic for automated scheduling
  - [ ] Add manual mode vs automatic mode switching
  - [ ] Handle conflicts between manual commands and price-based automation
  - [ ] Add status feedback to Loxone (current mode, battery state, etc.)
  - [ ] Create configuration for control topics and override behavior
  - [ ] Add comprehensive testing for control logic
  - [ ] Update documentation with control API

## Implementation Notes

### Command Structure (Proposed)
- `loxone/growatt/charge/enable` - Manual charge enable/disable
- `loxone/growatt/discharge/enable` - Manual discharge control  
- `loxone/growatt/export/enable` - Manual export control
- `loxone/growatt/mode` - Switch between "auto" and "manual" modes
- `loxone/growatt/status` - Status feedback to Loxone

### Override Logic
- Manual commands should temporarily override automated scheduling
- Need timeout mechanism to return to automatic mode
- Preserve safety limits (battery protection, grid constraints)
- Log all manual interventions for audit trail

### Safety Considerations
- Validate all incoming commands
- Implement rate limiting for control messages
- Maintain battery protection regardless of control source
- Add emergency stop functionality
