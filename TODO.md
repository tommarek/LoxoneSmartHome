# TODO - Loxone Smart Home

## âœ… Completed Tasks

### Async Operation & Resource Management (COMPLETED)
- [x] Improve async operation and shared resource handling
  - [x] Ensure thread-safe access to shared MQTT client
  - [x] Implement connection pooling for InfluxDB client
  - [x] Add proper async locks for critical sections
  - [x] Handle concurrent writes from multiple modules (UDP, Weather, Growatt)
  - [x] Implement retry logic with exponential backoff
  - [x] Add connection health monitoring
  
- [x] Database write optimization
  - [x] Implement write buffer with batch processing
  - [x] Configure optimal batch sizes for performance
  - [x] Add write queue with priority handling
  - [x] Monitor and log write performance metrics
  - [x] Handle backpressure when database is slow

### Logging Improvements (COMPLETED)
- [x] Show timestamps in local timezone (Europe/Prague) instead of UTC
  - [x] Update all logger formatters to use local timezone
  - [x] Make timezone configurable via settings
  - [x] Ensure consistency across all modules
  
- [x] Define service names for better log identification
  - [x] Add service prefix to all log messages (e.g., [UDP], [MQTT], [WEATHER], [GROWATT])
  - [x] Use consistent service naming convention
  - [x] Make it easy to filter logs by service

### Code Quality (COMPLETED)
- [x] Fix all linting issues (line length violations and whitespace)
- [x] Fix async operation logging errors during test cleanup
- [x] Ensure all tests pass (76/76)

## ðŸ“‹ Remaining Tasks

### Loxone Control Integration
- [ ] Implement ability to control charging/discharging/export from Loxone
  - [ ] Design MQTT topic structure for Loxone commands
  - [ ] Add MQTT subscribers for incoming control commands
  - [ ] Implement override logic for automated scheduling
  - [ ] Add manual mode vs automatic mode switching
  - [ ] Handle conflicts between manual commands and price-based automation
  - [ ] Add status feedback to Loxone (current mode, battery state, etc.)
  - [ ] Create configuration for control topics and override behavior
  - [ ] Add comprehensive testing for control logic
  - [ ] Update documentation with control API

## ðŸš€ Implementation Summary

### New Async Clients Created
- **AsyncInfluxDBClient** - Thread-safe InfluxDB client with:
  - Connection pooling (5-connection pool)
  - Batch processing (5000 points, 1s flush interval)
  - Retry logic with exponential backoff
  - Performance metrics tracking
  - Background connection monitoring

- **AsyncMQTTClient** - Thread-safe MQTT client with:
  - Publish queue for reliability
  - Automatic reconnection with retry logic
  - Thread-safe subscriber management
  - Concurrent callback execution
  - Connection health monitoring

### Enhanced Logging System
- **TimezoneAwareFormatter** - Custom log formatter with:
  - Local timezone support (Europe/Prague)
  - Service-specific prefixes ([UDP], [MQTT], [WEATHER], [GROWATT])
  - Configurable timezone via settings
  - Consistent formatting across all modules

### Test Coverage
- All 76 tests passing
- Fixed mock specifications for new async clients
- Added proper cleanup for async resources
- Comprehensive test coverage maintained

## Implementation Notes

### Command Structure (Proposed)
- `loxone/growatt/charge/enable` - Manual charge enable/disable
- `loxone/growatt/discharge/enable` - Manual discharge control  
- `loxone/growatt/export/enable` - Manual export control
- `loxone/growatt/mode` - Switch between "auto" and "manual" modes
- `loxone/growatt/status` - Status feedback to Loxone

### Override Logic
- Manual commands should temporarily override automated scheduling
- Need timeout mechanism to return to automatic mode
- Preserve safety limits (battery protection, grid constraints)
- Log all manual interventions for audit trail

### Safety Considerations
- Validate all incoming commands
- Implement rate limiting for control messages
- Maintain battery protection regardless of control source
- Add emergency stop functionality

## ðŸ“Š Current Status
- **System Status**: Fully functional with enhanced async operations
- **Test Coverage**: 76/76 tests passing
- **Code Quality**: All linting checks pass
- **Performance**: Optimized with connection pooling and batching
- **Logging**: Enhanced with timezone awareness and service prefixes
