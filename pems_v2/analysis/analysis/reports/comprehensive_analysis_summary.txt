THERMAL DYNAMICS ANALYSIS
------------------------------

HEATING USAGE = % of time heating system was actively running
• 0-25%: Very efficient (minimal heating needed)
• 25-50%: Normal usage for most rooms
• 50%+: High usage (consider insulation improvements)

DATA SOURCES:
• (Actual): Real relay switching data from Loxone - most accurate
• (Inferred): Estimated from temperature changes - less reliable

Room: chodba_nahore
  • Mean Temperature: 20.3°C
  • Temperature Range: 2.7°C
  • Heating Usage: 43.5% (Inferred)
  • Time Constant: 6.2 hours

Room: hosti
  • Mean Temperature: 19.0°C
  • Temperature Range: 5.2°C
  • Heating Usage: 51.0% (Inferred)
  • Time Constant: 2.7 hours

Room: spajz
  • Mean Temperature: 21.7°C
  • Temperature Range: 1.7°C
  • Heating Usage: 0.0% (Inferred)

SUMMARY:
• 3 rooms analyzed
• 0 rooms with actual relay data (most accurate)
• 3 rooms with inferred data (estimates)
• Average heating usage: 31.5%

HIGH USAGE ROOMS (>50%) - Consider improvements:
  • hosti: 51.0% (preprocessed)
  • loznice: 54.4% (preprocessed)

RELAY PATTERN ANALYSIS
------------------------------
Peak Demand: 12.7 kW
Peak Events: 153
Peak Hour: 9

Rooms Analyzed: 17
Average Switches/Day: 4.5

Total Heating Energy: 199.7 kWh


WEATHER CORRELATION ANALYSIS
------------------------------
• PV-Weather Correlations: Available
• Consumption-Weather Correlations: Available

RECOMMENDATIONS
------------------------------
• Monitor PV system performance during identified low-efficiency periods
• Optimize heating schedules based on thermal time constants
• Investigate high base load consumption periods for energy savings
• Consider demand response strategies during peak consumption hours
• High heating usage detected in: hosti, loznice - consider insulation improvements
